## Overview
Site created for a fictional company (if any company exists with this name, this site does not have anything to do with it) dealing with selling trucks at accessible prices. It is made as a personal project for exercising my skills along with my passion for trucks.

You can access the hosted site [here](https://truckdealz.herokuapp.com/html/main_page.php).
